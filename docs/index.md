# Charmed Spark Documentation

The Spark Client Snap is a utility client application that allows for running Apache Spark on Kubernetes in a simple and seamless manner. All necessary components are packed in a single confined [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/) package:

* [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) (binaries, executables and libraries)
* [spark8t](https://github.com/canonical/spark-k8s-toolkit-py) Python package to enhance Spark capabilities allowing to manage Spark jobs and service accounts, with hierarchical level of configuration
* Expose simple Snap commands to run and manage Spark Jobs

The `spark-client` Snap can be used to deploy and manage Apache Spark on different Kubernetes distributions, like
* [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/), which is the simplest production-grade conformant K8s. Lightweight and focused. 
Single command install on Linux, Windows and macOS.
    * Setup instructions are available in the Spark Tutorial [Set up the environment chapter](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/spark-client-snap-tutorial-setup-environment/8951)
* [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes/charmed-k8s), which is a platform independent, model-driven distribution of Kubernetes powered by [juju](https://juju.is/) 

The `spark-client` Snap can effectively be used by:
* cluster administrators, who create and manage Spark service accounts (as shown [here](/t/spark-client-snap-tutorial-setup-environment/8952)) 
* developers and data-scientists, who need to launch Spark Jobs (as shown [here](/t/spark-client-snap-tutorial-spark-submit/8953)) or perform interactive analysis
using `pyspark` and `spark-shell`  (as shown [here](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/spark-client-snap-tutorial-interactive-mode/8954))

The spark-client snap can be installed such as:
```
snap install spark-client --edge
```
